## Key Findings - Bar Coupons

### 1. Frequency is the Strongest Predictor
- Drivers who visit bars **>3 times/month**: **76.17%** acceptance rate
- Drivers who visit bars **â‰¤3 times/month**: **37.27%** acceptance rate
- **39% difference** - existing habits strongly predict coupon acceptance


### 2. Key Hypothesis
**Coupons reinforce existing behavior rather than create new behavior.** 
1. people who are going to bar are more likely accept the coupons.
2. drivers going bar more than 1 times in a month and above age of 25 has high rate of acceptance rate.
3. cost consious driver are more likely to accept coupons.
4. drivers having non-farming occupations are are most likely accept the coupons.
5. driver who never go to bars are least likely accept the coupons.

### 3. Findings and conclusions

- Overall coupon acceptance rate: **56.84%**
- Bar coupons had lower acceptance: **41.00%**

**Bar Coupon Analysis**
   - Visit Frequency Matters Most
   - Drivers visiting bars 3 or fewer times/month: 37.07% acceptance
   - Drivers visiting bars more than 3 times/month: **76.88% acceptance** (2x higher)
   - Bar-goers (>1/month) over age 25: **69.52% acceptance**, All others: 33.50% acceptance,  Difference: 36.02 percentage points
   - Bar-goers (>1/month), no kids, non-farming occupation: **71.32% acceptance** while All others: 29.60% acceptance, Having kids as passengers drastically reduces bar coupon acceptance
   - Drivers meeting favorable conditions (frequent bar/restaurant visits, younger age, no kids): **58.89% acceptance** while Drivers not meeting these conditions: 29.81% acceptance
   - Younger drivers (age 20) highest acceptance (63.44%), decreases with age
   - Occupation Healthcare Support (69.83%) and Construction (68.83%) highest; Retired (45.86%) and Legal (47.03%) lowest


### Conclusions

 - Drivers who regularly visit a venue type are 2x more likely to accept related coupons
 - Passenger type (especially having children) significantly impacts acceptance, particularly for bar coupons
 - Acceptance rates decline with age, with under-30 drivers showing highest engagement
