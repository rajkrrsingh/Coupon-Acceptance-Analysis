## Key Findings - Bar Coupons

### 1. Frequency is the Strongest Predictor
- Drivers who visit bars **>3 times/month**: **76.17%** acceptance rate
- Drivers who visit bars **â‰¤3 times/month**: **37.27%** acceptance rate
- **39% difference** - existing habits strongly predict coupon acceptance


### 2. Key Hypothesis
**Coupons reinforce existing behavior rather than create new behavior.** 
1. people who are going to bar are more likely accept the coupons.
2. drivers going bar more than 1 times in a month and above age of 25 has high rate of acceptance rate.
3. cost consious driver are more likely to accept coupons.
4. drivers having non-farming occupations are are most likely accept the coupons.
5. driver who never go to bars are least likely accept the coupons.
